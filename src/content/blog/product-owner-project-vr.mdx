description: Overview of my role as a Product Owner on Project VR
---

During the 3rd year of my studies at SAE Institute, we were tasked to work on two Unreal Engine 5 games that would be done in collaboration with the Audio and Game Art sections.
This is called the Specialisation Projects, since for the other sections it's the occasion to specialise themselves in their field.
As for the programmers, we mostly did any tasks that had to be done for the games.

In this blog post, I will present the work I did as a product owner on one of these games : Project VR.

## Table of Contents

## Context

Project VR is a VR game (who would have guessed !) that is inspired by escape games.
You start in an office with a dead body on the floor, and you have to get out of the room and solve the mystery at the same time.

The idea of this game was first brainstormed during the 2023 summer break.
Then in September, we reworked the game design until October.
A Vertical Slice of the game is due to release on February the 9th along with this blog post.

I also did the "DevOps" on this project (see my [blog post](../devops-in-specialisation-projects)) and a bit of programming.
Although I couldn't do as much as I wanted to, since my laptop died during the production of the game.

## Global Organisation

We had two games to make.
For these, the artists where split into two groups, but the programmers we weren't assigned to a particular project.
That being said, we still naturally went on one project or the other.

We decided to have two management roles : Producer and Product Owner.
The Producer is split between the two projects and the Product Owner is on one project only.
Sam was the Producer, Johanna the Product Owner on Project Girl and Kitty and I was the Product Owner of Project VR.
Sam's role was to make sure we had good group dynamics.
The Product Owner's roles were to decide which task had to be done for each sprint.

As you can see on this organization chart, the artists had roles assigned by their teachers, whereas we were left to choose what we wanted to do.
This was mostly decided by the skills of each and everyone.
That is how I ended up handling the "DevOps" part of the project.
Although we were technically on both games, since I am the Product Owner of Project VR, I ended up working on it exclusively.
This also meant that we were three programmers in total on the project : Edouard, Ben and me.

## Scrum

On this project we used (at least partially) the Scrum methodology.
We were guided to this by a lesson given by William Mari√©, which is a producer at Old Skull Games.
However, we didn't apply it very officially, meaning that we didn't have Scrum Masters (the PO where the Scrum Masters in some sense).

We divided the work in Sprints that lasted 2 weeks.
At the end of these, we did a meeting that was a fusion of a Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective and a Sprint Planning.
This was because there were very few moments where every member of the team could be present at school.

The backlog was managed on Google Sheet.
It was composed of User Stories that each had a complexity.
The goal was to be able to judge the amount of work that was done during the previous sprint and to adjust for the next one.
This didn't work out as expected though, since the amount of work the members could put in the project varied too much.

After the backlog was done, it was transcribed to tasks on a Trello board where we could track the advancement of each task.
The art assets also had their own google sheet so that it was easier to track for the artists and their teacher.

## Problems Encountered

The first problem we encountered when it comes to the organization on Project VR was that the artists were frustrated by the structure and they didn't understand why they weren't proposed the role of PO.
This led to a meeting to explain why, and the situation was mostly resolved.
You can read more about it on [Sam's blog post](https://sstyles93.github.io/blog/posts/ProjectProducing/).

Another issue we had was that we were told that this year, the artists would not be externs on the project, but they would be more involved.
This didn't end up being the case, as the project was optional and non-graded for them.
It led to us making poor decisions on the priority of some tasks.

This, in turn, led to the artists feeling like they weren't being heard enough on their feedback.
We tried to solve it with a meeting that just ended up making things worse.
This led me to me resigning from my role as a PO on the project, especially when it comes to communicating with the artists.
I gave my role to Sam.

## Conclusion

To conclude, being a PO on this project was really hard, especially with the time given and the amount of work that had to be done.
